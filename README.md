# PyBer_Analysis

## I. Overview of Project

### Background
As a data analyst for PyBer, a ride-sharing app company, we were tasked to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization  for the CEO using Pandas and Matplotlib.

### Objective
As an additional assignment, the CEO requested a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## II. [Analysis and Results](PyBer_Challenge.ipynb)
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
